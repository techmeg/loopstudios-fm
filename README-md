## Overview

A fun layout exercise with a few sneaky challenges.

### The challenge

There is some minor Javascript to control the mobile menu, but this is mainly a
CSS challenge. Without the use of Figma or Sketch, I had to do some guessing
about color overlays/gradients for the images, but I got reasonably close.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox
to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You
can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long
the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to
take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase
it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and
update the file path in the image above.

## My process

I took a first pass at the HTML, some of which I altered as the styling
progressed. For instance, I was hoping to use the img tag for the VR projects,
but ultimately realized I would need to add a gradient background to ensure that
the titles of each could be read.

I tackled the mobile design next; and views of the landscape orientation of
phones influenced the breakpoint and styling of the main title. I ended up with
somewhat messy breakpoints, again mostly driven by the difficulty of managing
the main enclosed title element.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working
through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you
want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
