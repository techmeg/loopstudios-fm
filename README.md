## Overview

A fun layout exercise with a few sneaky challenges.

### The challenge

There is some minor Javascript to control the mobile menu, but this is mainly a
CSS challenge. Without the use of Figma or Sketch, I had to do some guessing
about color overlays/gradients for the images.

## My process

I took a first pass at the HTML, some of which I altered as the styling
progressed. For instance, I was hoping to use the img tag for the VR projects,
but ultimately realized I would need to add a gradient background to ensure that
the titles of each could be read.

I tackled the mobile design next; and views of the landscape orientation of
phones influenced the breakpoint and styling of the main title. I ended up with
somewhat messy breakpoints, again mostly driven by the difficulty of managing
the main enclosed title element.
